# Theme

<Description>
 An interface for managing MindDrop's theme. 
</Description>

## Hooks

Hooks provide access to themes from inside React components. Unlike resources accessed using static methods, hooks will cause the component to rerender when the data changes.

### useAppearance

Returns the theme's current appearance.

```ts
useAppearance(): ThemeAppearance
```

### useAppearanceSetting

Returns the theme's current appearance setting.

```ts
useAppearance(): ThemeAppearanceSetting
```

## Static methods

### getAppearance

Returns the theme's current appearance.

```ts
Theme.getAppearance(): ThemeAppearance
```

### setAppearance

Sets the theme's current appearance. Dispatches a `theme:appearance:set-value` event.

```ts
Theme.setAppearance(core: Core, value: ThemeAppearance): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'value',
      type: 'ThemeAppearance',
      required: true,
      description: "The theme's current appearance.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### getAppearanceSetting

Returns the theme's appearance setting.

```ts
Theme.getAppearanceSetting(): ThemeAppearanceSetting
```

### setAppearanceSetting

Sets the theme's appearance setting. Dispatches a `theme:appearance:set-setting` event.

```ts
Theme.setAppearanceSetting(core: Core, value: ThemeAppearanceSetting): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'value',
      type: 'ThemeAppearanceSetting',
      required: true,
      description: "The theme's appearance setting.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### addEventListener

Adds theme specific event listeners. Equivalent to calling `addEventListener` directly on `core`, but provides more advanced type definitions.

```ts
Theme.addEventListener(core: Core, event: ThemeEvent, callback: EventListenerCallback): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'event',
      type: 'ThemeEvent',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The event type to listen for. See the theme events section below for available events.',
    },
    {
      name: 'callback',
      type: 'EventListenerCallback',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The callback fired when the event occurs. See the theme events section below for the data passed to the callback.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### removeEventListener

Removes theme specific event listeners. Equivalent to calling `removeEventListener` directly on `core`, but provides more advanced type definitions.

```ts
Themes.removeEventListener(core: Core, event: ThemeEvent, callback: EventListenerCallback): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'event',
      type: 'ThemeEvent',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The event type for which to remove the event listener.',
    },
    {
      name: 'callback',
      type: 'EventListenerCallback',
      required: true,
      description: 'The callback of the event listener to remove.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Theme events

See below the table for more details on the data passed by theme related events.

<EventsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'theme:appearance:set-value',
      data: 'ThemeAppearance',
      description: 'Dispatched when the theme appearance is changed.',
    },
    {
      name: 'theme:appearance:set-setting',
      data: 'ThemeAppearanceSetting',
      description: 'Dispatched when the theme appearance setting is changed.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Theme event data types

Theme events are dispatched with one of the following types of data.

#### ThemeAppearance

The current theme appearance. See the [Theme](/docs/extensions/types/theme) interface page for more details.

#### ThemeAppearanceSetting
