# ViewConfig

<Description>
  A configuration object used to register views.
</Description>

Views are used to render content in the main content area of MindDrop's window (on the right of the sidebar). MindDrop renders a single view at a time.

Views need to be registered before they can be opneded using the [`Views.register`](/docs/extensions/api/views#register) method.

## Static views

Static views simply render the view component provided as part of the [`View`](/docs/extensions/types/view) when registering a view.

## Instance views

Instance views are rendererd using a persistently stored [`ViewInstance`](/docs/extensions/types/view-instance) document passed in to the view component.

The view instance document allows for storing data related to a particular instance of a view. For example, topics are rendered using view instances which store the filter and layout options for each view instance.

View instances can be creqated using the [`Views.createInstance`](/docs/extensions/api/views#createinstanceview) method.
