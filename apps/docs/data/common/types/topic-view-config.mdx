# TopicViewConfig

<Description>
  A configuration object used to register topic views.
</Description>

Topics render their content using instances of a special type of view called topic views. Topic views need to be registered using the [`Topics.registerView`](/docs/extensions/api/topics#registerview) method before they can be used.

<InterfaceTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'id',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The ID of the topic view. Must be unique accross the app.',
    },

      description:
        'Called when data is inserted into an open topic view instance, usually in the form of a drag and drop or paste event.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onCreate

Called when a new instance of the topic view is created. Should return any custom data used to setup the view.

Note that default `TopicViewInstance` data such as `id`, `view`, `topic`, `createdAt`, etc. are set automatically and should not be returned by this method.

```ts
onCreate(core: Core, topic: Topic): object
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'topic',
      type: 'Topic',
      required: true,
      description: 'The topic for which the view was created.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onDelete

Called when an instance of the topic view is deleted. Useful for cleaning up any artifacts created by the view instance.

Note that this method does not need to delete the topic view instance itself, just any data that would be left over.

```ts
onDelete(core: Core, viewInstance: ViewInstance): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The deleted view instance.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onAddDrops

Called on all of a topic's views when drops are added, unarchived, or restored to the topic.

```ts
onAddDrops(core: Core, viewInstance: ViewInstance, drops: DropMap, metadata: AddDropMetadata): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'drops',
      type: 'DropMap',
      required: true,
      description: 'The drops which were added to the topic.',
    },
    {
      name: 'metadata',
      type: 'AddDropsMetadata',
      description: 'Metadata about the event. See below for details.',
    },
  ]}
/>

#### AddDropsMetadata

Metadata about the event when drops are added to a topic. Contains the ID of the view instance into which the drop was added (or `null` if not added by a view) and any other data added by the view which added the drop.

<InterfaceTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'string | null',
      required: true,
      description: (
        <span>
          The ID of the view instance into which the drop was
          inserted.<Code>null</Code> if the drop was not inserted into
          a view.
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

Additionally, the metadata object can contain values added by the view which added the drop.

### onRemoveDrops

Called on all of a topic's views when drops are archived, deleted, or permanently deleted from the topic.

```ts
onRemoveDrops(core: Core, topic: Topic, viewInstance: ViewInstance, drops: DropMap): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'topic',
      type: 'Topic',
      required: true,
      description: 'The topic from which the drop was removed.',
    },
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'drops',
      type: 'DropMap',
      required: true,
      description: 'The drops which were removed from the topic.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onAddSubtopics

Called on all view instances when subtopics are added, unarchived, or restored into a topic.

```ts
onAddSubtopics(core: Core, viewInstance: ViewInstance, subtopics: TopicMap): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'subtopics',
      type: 'TopicMap',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The topics which were added as subtopics to the topic.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onRemoveSubtopics

Called on all view instances when subtopics are removed, unarchived, or restored from a topic.

```ts
onRemoveSubtopics(core: Core, viewInstance: ViewInstance, subtopics: TopicMap): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'subtopics',
      type: 'TopicMap',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The topics which were removed as subtopics from the topic.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onInsertData

Called when data is inserted into an open topic view instance, usually in the from of a drag and drop or paste event. Only called on the affected view.

Note that this method is only called when raw data such as text or files are inserted. If the data consists of drops or topics, `onAddDrops` or `onAddTopics` are called instead.

```ts
onInsertData(core: Core, viewInstance: ViewInstance, data: DataInsert): void
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'viewInstance',
      type: 'ViewInstance',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'data',
      type: 'DataInsert',
      required: true,
      description: 'The inserted data.',
    },
