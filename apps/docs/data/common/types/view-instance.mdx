# ViewInstance

<Description>
  An interface for describing MindDrop's view instances.
</Description>

View instances provide a way to persistently store data related to a particular instance of a view.

For example, topics are rendered using view instances which store the filter and layout options for each of the topic's different views.

<InterfaceTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'id',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: (
        <span>
          The ID of the <Code>ViewInstance</Code> document.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'view',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The ID of the registered view rendered by this view instance.',
    },
    {
      name: 'createdAt',
      type: 'Date',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The timestamp at which the view instance was created.',
    },
    {
      name: 'updatedAt',
      type: 'Date',
      required: true,
      description: (
        <span>
          The timestamp at which the view instance was last updated.
          Equal to the <Code>createdAt</Code> value if the view
          instance has not been updated.
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

Additionally, view instances support adding any custom data fields needed for the view.
