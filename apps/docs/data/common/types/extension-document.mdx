# ExtensionDocument

<Description>
  A document used to store and sync an extension's state and
  configuration.
</Description>

An extension's state, such as which topics it is enabled in, is stored in the database as an `ExtensionDocument`. Extension documents are synced across a user's app instances in order to ensure that each instance uses the same extensions with the same configuration.
