# Styling

<Description>
  MindDrop UI are styled using plain old CSS files. This makes
  themeing and customization a breeze.
</Description>

## Classes

All components have a root class name and prop based class names. For instance, the `Button` component has a root class of `button` and prop based classes such as `size-large`, `variant-contained`, `disabled`.

A large, primary-colored, contained button which is disabled would have the following class name: `button size-large color-primary variant-contained disabled`.

See the [mapPropsToClasses](/docs/ui/utilities/map-props-to-classes) function for more details on prop based classes.

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

## Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/dialog) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.accordion-item {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.accordion-item[data-state='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Summary

MindDrop UI were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.
