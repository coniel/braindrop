# Introduction

<Description>
  An open-source UI component library for building high-quality,
  accessible MindDrop extensions.
</Description>

MindDrop UI is a component library built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction) with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience. You can use these components to develop MindDrop extensions or even your own apps.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) where possible. We handle many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Learn more in our [accessibility](docs/primitives/overview/accessibility) overview.

### CSS based styling

Components are styled with pure CSS using semantic class names, and CSS variable based colors. This makes custom styling and theming a breeze.

### Opened

MindDrop UI components are designed to be customized to suit your needs. Our open component architecture provides you granular access to each component part, so you can wrap them and add your own event listeners, props, or refs.

### Uncontrolled

Where applicable, components are uncontrolled by default but can also be controlled, alternatively. All of the behavior wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible, without needing to create any local states.

### Developer experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. MindDrop UI provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API and class names, creating a consistent and predictable experience. We've also implemented an `asChild` prop, giving users full control over the rendered element.
