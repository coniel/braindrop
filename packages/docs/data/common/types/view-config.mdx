# ViewConfig

<Description>Configuration for views opened in the app.</Description>

Views can render a breadcrumb trail leading up to them by proving the `breadcrumb` config.

Views which render a resource, such as a topic, must provide both the resource ID and the resource type.

      name: 'breadcrumbs',

        'Breadcrumbs leading up to and including the view.',
    },
    {
      name: 'resourceId',
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          ID of the resource displayed by the view (e.g. topic ID).
          Must also provide <Code>resourceType</Code> if resource is
          provided.
