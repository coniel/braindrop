# Topic

<Description>
  A hierarchical way of organising content in MindDrop.
</Description>

Topics provide a hierarchical way of organising content inside of MindDrop. They can be nested inside of other topics (then referred to as subtopics). A topic can appear as a subtopic inside multiple other topics.

Topics which appear at the top level of the hierarchy are referred to as root topics. Note that root topics can still be included as subtopics inside other topics.
