# EventListenerCallback

<Description>Callback fired in response to events.</Description>

MindDrop uses an event driven API. Extensions can react to events happening throughout the app by creating event listerners with an callback fired each time the event occurs.

Event listeners are added as follows:

```ts
function onCreateTopic(payload: EventPayload<Topic>) {
  const { type, source, data } = payload;
  ...
}

app.addEventListener('create-topic', onCreateTopic): void
```

The `EventListenerCallback` is called with a single `payload` attribute, with the following properties.

<ArgsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'type',
      type: 'string',
      description:
        'The event type. Useful if your callback is passed to multiple event listeners of different types.',
    },
    {
      name: 'source',
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          The source from which the event was dispatched. Either an
          extension ID or <Code>'app'</Code> if dispatched by the app
          istelf. Useful for ignoring events dispatched by your own
          extension.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'data',
      type: 'EventData',
      description: (
        <span>
          The data associated with the event. Check event specific
          docs for the type of data dispatched with different events.
          In the example above, the data is a topic.
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>
