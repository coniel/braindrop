# EventListener

<Description>React to events happening throught the app.</Description>

MindDrop uses an event driven API. Extensions can react to events happening throughout the app by creating event listerners. Extensions can also dispatch events themselves.

## App events

<EventsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'load-topics',
      data: 'Topic[]',
      description:
        'Dispatched when topics are loaded into the app from an external source (e.g. file system).',
    },
    {
      name: 'load-drops',
      data: 'Drop[]',
      description:
        'Dispatched when drops are loaded into the app from an external source (e.g. file system).',
    },
    {
      name: 'insert-data',
      data: 'DataInsert',
      description:
        'Dispatched when data is indiscriminately inserted into the app, such as by a paste event or file drop.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Topic events

Topic events affect a single topic.

See the below the table for more details on the data passed by topic related events.

<EventsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'add-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is added.',
    },
    {
      name: 'update-topic',
      data: 'TopicChanges',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is updated.',
    },
    {
      name: 'move-topic',
      data: 'TopicMove',
      description:
        'Dispatched when a topic is moved into another topic or to the root level.',
    },
    {
      name: 'archive-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is archived.',
    },
    {
      name: 'unarchive-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is unarchived.',
    },
    {
      name: 'trash-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is moved to the trash.',
    },
    {
      name: 'restore-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description:
        'Dispatched when a topic is restored from the trash.',
    },
    {
      name: 'delete-topic',
      data: 'Topic',
      description: 'Dispatched when a topic is permanently deleted.',
    },
  ]}
/>
