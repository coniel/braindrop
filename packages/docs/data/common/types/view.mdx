# View

<Description>
  An interface for describing MindDrop's views.
</Description>

Views are used to render content in the main content area of MindDrop's window (on the right of the sidebar). MindDrop renders a single view at a time. Views are opened using the `App.openView` method (see the [App](/docs/extensions/api/app) page for details).

Views can render a breadcrumb trail leading up to them by proving a `breadcrumbs` parameter consisting of an array of view objects, with the current view being last in the array.

Views which render a resource, such as a topic, contain a `resource` parameter describing the resource.

<InterfaceTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'id',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description: 'The view ID.',
    },
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
      description:
        'The name of the view or the name of the resource rendered by the view.',
    },
    {
      name: 'breadcrumbs',
      type: 'View[]',
      description:
        'Breadcrumbs leading up to and including the view.',
    },
    {
      name: 'resource',
      type: 'ViewResource',
      description:
        'The resource rendered by the view. See below for details.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### ViewResource

<InterfaceTable

    },
    {
