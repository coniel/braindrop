# Drop

<Description>The content of MindDrop.</Description>

Drops are created in one of two formats: `markdown` or `json`. Markdown is intended for drops which are primarily text based, such as a note. JSON is intended for drops which are not edited by the user or not text based, such as a web page bookmark.

All drops share a basic interface which can be extended to suit your extension's needs.
