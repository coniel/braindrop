## Lifecycle methods

MindDrop extensions are defined using a set of lifecycle methods. The app calls these methods at given stages of the extension's life or in response to certain events.

### onRun

Called when the app initializes the extension on startup. Use to set up event listeners.

```ts
onRun(core: Core) => void
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />

### onInstall

Called once when the extension is installed. Directly followed by a call to `onActivate`.

```ts
onInstall(core: Core) => Promise<void>
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />

### onActivate

Called once when the extension is activated globally. Called directly after `onInstall`, but can also be called independently at a later stage if the extension was temporarily disabled.

```ts
onActivate(core: Core) => void
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />

### onActivateTopics

Called once when the extension is activaed for given topics.

```ts
onActivateTopics(core: Core, topics: Topic[]) => Promise<void>
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'topics',
      type: 'Topic[]',
      required: true,
      description: 'The topics for which the extension was enabled.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onUpdate

Called once when the extension has been updated to a new version. Directly followed by a call to `onActivate`.

```ts
onUpdate(core: Core) => Promise<void>
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />

### onDeactivate

Called once when the extension is deactivated globally. Called directly before `onUninstall`, but can also be called independently if the user disables the extension without uninstalling it.

```ts
onDeactivate(core: Core) => Promise<void>
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />

### onDeactivateTopics

Called once when the extension is deactivaed for given topics.

```ts
onDeactivateTopics(core: Core) => Promise<void>
```

<ArgsTable
  core
  data={[
    {
      name: 'topics',
      type: 'Topic[]',
      required: true,
      description: 'The topics for which the extension was disabled.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### onUninstall

Called once when the extension is uninstalled. Use to clean up any data stored by your extension. Always directly preceeded by a call to `onDeactivate`.

```ts
onUninstall(core: Core) => void
```

<ArgsTable core data={[]} />
